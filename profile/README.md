Vikram has been **more than just a CTO** and an architect of our engineering systems, **heâ€™s been the architect of our dreams**. His passion for delving into every detail, understanding every nuance, and then sharing that knowledge with the team has been nothing short of inspiring. **A true geek** in the most affectionate sense of the word, Vikramâ€™s depth and passion have turned technical challenges into pieces of cake, and the simplest of problems a joy to solve for. The countless conversations we've all had with him, filled with his eagerness to explore, have undoubtedly left us a little bit wiser.

But Vikramâ€™s contributions go **beyond his technical brilliance**. He could turn a marathon coding session into a jam session with his guitar, the one who reminds us that beneath the deadlines and challenges, weâ€™re all here **to create something extraordinary**â€”and have fun while doing it. His sense of play isnâ€™t just a break from the grind; itâ€™s a core part of our culture.

Vikramâ€™s influence is imprinted on every part of Headout. From the systems we use every day to the culture we cherish, his impact is profound. He didnâ€™t just build our core pillars; **he designed the very foundation on which we stand**. Whenever weâ€™ve faced a roadblock, Vikram has been there, not just with answers but with a depth of understanding that only he could provide. The standards heâ€™s set for the quality of our work arenâ€™t just high; theyâ€™re the benchmark weâ€™ll aim for every day from here on out. His legacy isnâ€™t confined to the codebase or the engineering solutions heâ€™s crafted; **itâ€™s in how heâ€™s pushed each of us to be better, to reach higher, and to never settle for anything less than excellence.**

Though Vikram is stepping away from his day-to-day, his influence remains woven into the fabric of Headout. Weâ€™re stronger, smarter, and more united because of him, and his contributions will continue to shape our future. We know that wherever his journey takes him next, **his legacy at Headout will endure**, in every line of code, every challenge overcome, and every moment of fun. ðŸ’œ
